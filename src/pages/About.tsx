        subtitle="ALL INDIA MAJLIS-E-ITTEHADUL MUSLIMEEN (AIMIM) has its roots in the efforts of the Muslims of Deccan, in the late 1920s, who had come together to unite the community on a common platform. Their objective was to promote the socio-economic and educational development of Muslims. The organization, initially known as Ittehad Bainal Muslimeen, was founded at a meeting of prominent Muslims, including Ulema-e-Mashaeqeen, hosted by Nawab Mahmood Khan Qiledar on 12th November 1927 at Hyderabad."
